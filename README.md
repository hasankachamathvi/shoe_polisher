👞 SMART SHOE POLISHER

IoT / Robotics-Based Automated Shoe Cleaning & Polishing System

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Shoe Polisher is an automated robotic system designed to clean and polish shoes without human intervention. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of a shoe and automatically performs a two-stage process: dust cleaning and shoe polishing using motorized roller brushes.

Controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, the robot activates motors and a solenoid valve to dispense polish at the correct time, ensuring efficient and consistent results. This project aims to save time, reduce manual effort, and maintain professional appearance in busy environments.

The system is suitable for schools, offices, hotels, military academies, and public places.

🎯 Aim

To design and develop a low-cost, efficient, and fully automated shoe polishing robot that minimizes human interaction while delivering consistent cleaning and polishing results.

✅ Objectives

Automate shoe cleaning and polishing using a dual-stage process

Detect shoe presence using ultrasonic sensors

Control motors, relays, and polish dispensing using Arduino

Reduce time and effort required for manual shoe maintenance
